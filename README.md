I'M TRYING TO SOLVE PRINTING THE CHOICES ARRAY FROM THE INDEX.JS FILE AS AN OBJECT SO IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A LIST- IS IT A PARSE FUNCTION?

  ## Description
  <!--undefined hidden-->
  * Working remotelyprior to Covid, keeping a schedule was the norm, even from home.  However, during Covid, time has not been recorded as much, and we need to face Time again!
  * It was about Time! Seriously, work and life balance has been a topic of research and consternation. Procrastination affects one third of the population and I am personally in that category!
  * Simply writing down tasks and goals has been statistically proven to help you accomplish them.
  * In terms of coding, moment.js is fascinating and I hope to research how it works. It starts with one moment, then expands. 
  * Right now, the concept of the Duel is something that stands out, because it is often truly a battle.  There are no literal casualties, but indirectly many opportunities are lost when one ignores the challenge time presents us with everyday, to get up and duel your procrastinating self.
